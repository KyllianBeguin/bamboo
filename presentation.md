# Why Bamboo?
*A bit of storytelling*

During Machine Learning classes, we needed data to practice...
Teacher(s) asked us to go for data scraping...
Lost tons of time making a web scraping script!

Also web scraping is kinda illegal (hello robot.txt)

# Why Bamboo?

1. No more <u>**web scraping**</u>!
2. Work on <u>**true use case**</u> data
3. Generate data with your own <u>**expectations**</u>
